TBD
all - style nav bar
all - fonts
https://bootstrapbay.com/blog/google-web-fonts/


index - images are not centered since we only have three (instead of four)
index - h1 font size is too large on big view

all carousels - See the class lecture about carousels and follow the usability guidelines - turn off the automatic start feature
all carousels - style all the images -- maybe as thumbnails, at least provide some sort of decent margin

timeline - Use a carousel to flip between A and B sides of each single
timeline - Year shadow boxes should fit better
timeline - Year circles need an icon; maybe a clock or calendar symbol?
timeline - Update the alt text on the flip sides of the images
timeline - carousel usability: follow class instructions, what about on phone -- can you still switch images?

img's - check the alt and title properties on all of them to be sure they are correct

nav - the "Darryn Kozak" brand button does not do anything.  Should it?
