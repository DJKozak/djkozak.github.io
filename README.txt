TBD
all - style nav bar
all - fonts
https://bootstrapbay.com/blog/google-web-fonts/

index - images are not centered since we only have three (instead of four)

all carousels - See the class lecture about carousels and follow the usability guidelines

C carousel - style all the images -- maybe as thumbnails, at least provide some sort of margin

timeline - Use a smaller number of years than originally (don't have time to do it all for the class)
timeline - Use a carousel to flip between A and B sides of each single
timeline - Year shadow boxes should fit better
timeline - Year circles need an icon; maybe a clock or calendar symbol?
